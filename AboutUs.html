            <p>This rollercoaster is called 'Life'.
            It was called 'Life' because the rollercaster,
            when we first made it, had many up and downs just like life.
            When life gets hard because say its hard. They say it is like uphills
            because it is so hard after that point on. But other say that life is easy.
            They say it is  just like riding a bike down a hill versus going up a hill.
            The rollercoaster presents that too. People say that life goes upside down.
            But in our rollercoaster it comes back up. Just like you should do whenever
            you are in a tough situation.</p>

            <p>A water slide (also referred to as a flume, or water chute)
               is a type of slide designed for warm-weather or indoor
               recreational use at water parks. Water slides differ in
               their riding method and therefore size. Some slides require
               riders to sit directly on the slide, or on a raft or tube
               designed to be used with the slide.
               A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water
               to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down
               its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders
               travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run
               into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool)
               or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually
               stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide,
               so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.</p>

                <p>India, officially the Republic of India
                 (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is
                  the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, 
                  and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean 
                  on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal 
                  on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;
                   China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar 
                  to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka
                   and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime
                    border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. The nation's capital
                     city is New Delhi. Just like this roller-coaster!</p>
